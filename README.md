# air-quality-index
Predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed

## Features
- Extracts key environmental factors affecting air quality
- Uses a machine learning model for AQI prediction
- Provides insights into how weather conditions influence air quality
- Flask-based backend for handling model predictions
- Interactive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JS

## Factors Affecting Air Quality
- Precipitation: More rainfall generally improves air quality by washing out pollutants.
- Temperature: Higher temperatures can worsen air quality due to increased chemical reactions.
- Wind Speed: Stronger winds help disperse pollutants, improving air quality.

  ## Tech Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Regression Models)
- Deployment: Flask (local server)
